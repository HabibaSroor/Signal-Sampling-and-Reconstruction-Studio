# Sampling Theory Studio
Sampling an analog signal is a fundamental aspect of digital signal processing. The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem plays a pivotal role in ensuring the accurate recovery of signals during the sampling process. This desktop application aims to illustrate the concepts of signal sampling and recovery, emphasizing the significance and validation of the Nyquist rate.
## Features :
### 1. Load & Compose:

- Load a signal from a file or compose a signal using the signal mixer.
- Add multiple sinusoidal signals of different frequencies, magnitudes and phase differences to the signal mixer.
- Remove any components from the signal mixer.
-Remove all components
### 2. Sample & Recover:

- Sample the signal at different frequencies (actual frequency or normalized frequency).
- Use the sampled points to recover the original signal using Whittaker–Shannon interpolation.
 - Display the original signal, the sampled points, the reconstructed signal, and the difference between the original and reconstructed signals in three separate graphs.
### 3. Additive noise:

- Add noise to the loaded signal with a custom SNR level.
- Show the dependency of the noise effect on the signal frequency.

### 4. Real-time:
- Perform sampling and recovery in real time upon user changes.
